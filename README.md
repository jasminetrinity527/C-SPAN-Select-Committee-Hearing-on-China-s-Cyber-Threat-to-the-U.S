This document is a research paper I conducted by viewing the hearing of C-CPAN: Select Committee Hearing on China's Cyber Threat to the U.S
On January 31, 2024, the Select Committee Hearing on China’s Cyber Threat to the U.S. addressed concerns surrounding the cybersecurity of the United States and its infrastructure originating from China. As this remain as a lingering issue that would potentially cause severe chaos, the committee goes through many threats that previously happened and the current threats that are currently in motion. The hearing aimed to discuss and mitigate China’s cyber capabilities such as the CCP, which means the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP seeks control over people’s lives economically, politically, and physically by any means possible.The Select Committee consisted of top officials that testified. An FBI director, Christopher Wray, National Cyber Director Harry Coker, and National Secuirty Agency Director Gen. Paul Nakasone they testified on behalf of China’s cyber threat to the U.S. homeland and national security before the House Select Committee on U.S. – China Competition.
